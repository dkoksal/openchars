openchars
=========

Openchars(Working name) is a tool for archiving, accessing, and viewing what hopefully will be a vast collection of 2d cel animations for use in RPG maker type games.
---------
Openchars is intended to provide all the functionality of the charaset generators at http://charas-project.net in a modern package.  
I'm not great at separating the work in web development projects so I'm going to try and keep things up to date on their face by keeping track of them in this readme file until I find a better way to plagon this project.

 * PHP Components: The idea is to do very little on the server-side other than retrieve the image files for placement on the page and for saving files to the server. It's *just* handing the information to the client program to display.  
    -Image Objects
 * HTML/CSS Components: The basic page layout is a static HTML page with a CSS layout suitable for Desktop PC's at this time but with the potential for a Mobile layout.  
    -Current Menu: This span contains a menu which displays buttons which manipulate the current image for the current layer. Planned buttons are  
        'switch to next picture category' 
        'switch to previous picture category' 
        'Switch displayed picture to next in category'
        'Switch displayed picture to previous in category'
        'move layer back one level(behind other pictures)' 
        'move layer forward one level(in front of other pictures)' 
        'apply filter to layer' 
        'save image as...'
Might be fun to propose some social features. Lots of space for buttons in the new cleaner layout.  
        'Create Gallery' ('Create Demo'?)
        'Share on Twitter/Facebook/Diaspora*/etc'
    -Sprite Display: This window contains feedback about the image as it is generated. It gives back 3 things:  
        'On the far left, an image of the Sprite with all layers as it would be exported to a PNG'
        'Right of the full preview, a preview of the current picture on the current layer'
        'Right of the layer preview, layer information(layer position, image metadata)'
    -Contribute Menu: Designed to make it easy to contribute new assets to the site. It has a button for selecting a file from the local disk, fields for entering information about the image and selecting which category to place it on by default.
 * Javascript/jQuery Components: The Javascript/jQuery components are the most important. I'm pretty sure I need to be binding functions to the HTML events above, but I need to get a clear picture of what I'm doing before I do this section.
